# OrangeBot
OrangeBot is a CS:GO matchmaking bot written in node.js. It uses a logaddress and rcon to execute server commands based on chat !commands. This means it works on a vanilla CS:GO server.

## Howto
```
npm install
node orangebot.js
```
You can start a BO3 match with `!start de_dust2 de_cache de_mirage` in game chat. Both teams have to `!ready` once to start the match. A knife round will start before each map. Players can `!pause` the game on next freezetime if they want to.
